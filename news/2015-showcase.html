			<p class="category-description" style="text-align: left;">There's no better way to ring in the new year other than sharing some incredible news. I'm pleased to announce my website is live and running. To wrap up what's been an absolutely incredible year for my personal endeavors, I want to begin a (hopefully) yearly tradition: a video showcase of my creations this past year. Gameplay moments from each entry are backed by music from Kai Theobald-Coates, who produces most of the music you hear in each game.
			<br /><br />
			Take a moment and enjoy the tour of 2015's fruits. With this release and the new website, my aim is to continue putting out content like this - videos, articles, and information about the design process and the finished product you see in front of you. If any of the games strike your fancy, feel free to give them a try! Everything's available from the <a href="../games/index.html">Games</a> page.
			<br /><br />
			Here's to a great year, and the one ahead!
