<h2><i><center>About this project</center></i></h2>
<p>RunGun started as a way to kill time in an especially boring end-of-year segment of a high school Computer Science class. Inspired by its predecessor, WalkPunch, RunGun was born. RunGun was made with the full permission of the original creators of WalkPunch, who support this game in its entirety.
<br><br>
For a time, this project was moved into Java as a learning exercise for that language. After determining that it would be more accessible in its native HTML/JS format, it was ported back. Ever since, the project has been occasionally updated and still receives sporadic updates. Typos are also fixed when found.

<h2><i><center>FAQ</center></i></h2>
<p><b>So who are you?</b></br>
I'm a Computer Science student who gets bored easily. I like to make things and post them online. They're usually silly.<p>
<p><b>Why do you keep making typos?</b><br>
I'm an actual idiot and notepad++ does have spellcheck now. They'll get fixed. Eventually.</p>
<p><b>How long is this game?</b></br>
Currently unfinished. At the moment, there are 345 individual cases, more if you count generated text and situational differences for boss battles and puzzles.</p>
