<center><h2>about pilocomics</h2>

Pilocomics were a satire for a series of webcomics a bunch of people on a forum made in response to other's poor-quality webcomics. Since they were increasingly crappy and meant to mock the previous comic author, I took it upon my self to end the chain of dumb. This is the result. Updated whenever, occasionally non worksafe due to language.
