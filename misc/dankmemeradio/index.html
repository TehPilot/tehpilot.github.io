		   <b>Criminal Background</b><br >
		   McGuiness (name unconfirmed), better known by his stage name "Dickshoe McGee", is a disruptive and obnoxious audio technician presently on the run from law enforcement. The World Coalition of Public Radio (WCPR) has an extensive record on McGuiness, who began broadcasting his pirate radio show "Dank Meme Radio" over news and entertainment outlets in the early spring season.<br /><br />
		   
		   When law enforcement officials traced the broadcast to his homemade studio, it was found to be wired with hidden traps and inflammitory notes degrading the World Coalition of Public Radio. The traps were then set off remotely, killing an officer and injuring a number of others. Since this incident, attempts to apprehend McGuiness have failed. His radio show, consisting of unlicensed rebroadcasts, crass commentary, and unpleasant original "remixes" of original content. McGuiness and his apparent cohorts (aliases unknown) are using stolen WCPR equipment, and have broadcasted their show from both in-house, homemade studio rooms and atop radio towers (including, famously, from the very top of the Empire State Building.<br /><br />
		   
		   As McGuiness tends to leave traps in his wake, he is assumed to be armed and highly dangerous. If you have any information on his whereabouts, notify your local law enforcement agency and WCPR. If you see McGuinness, <B>DO NOT PURSUE HIM</b>.
