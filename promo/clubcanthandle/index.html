		<h1>Turn down for what?</h1>
		<p class="main"><i>The Club Can't Even Handle Me Right Now</i> is a freeware game currently being developed for the Windows (and hopefully soon Mac) platforms. Assume the role of an intrepid partygoer in a quest to get out of the given establishment because you've had a few too many drinks. Embark on various side quests and objectives to cement yourself as the life of the party scene, taking the city by storm as party sites fall one by one to your reign of intoxicated power.</p>

		<h2>A party started</h2>
		<p class="main">Work on this project started early last year, mostly as a joke. I had made a game a long, long time ago that focused around one very particular gimmick. The screen would consistently rotate in a circle, and the player object would diligently follow the cursor. As the cursor did not rotate with the screen, the player would never be capable of walking in a straight line without tremendous effort.<br /><br />And thus, <i>The Club Can't Even Handle Me Right Now</i> was born after revisiting the concept.</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Putting on beer goggles</h2>
		<p class="main">With the primary mechanic being the screen rotation, this game was originally set out to be based around other visual limitations and thematic obstacles, all to convey a sense of drunkenness.</p>
