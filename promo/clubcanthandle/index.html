		<h1>Turn down for what?</h1>
		<p class="main"><i>The Club Can't Even Handle Me Right Now</i> is a freeware game currently being developed for the Windows (and hopefully soon Mac) platforms. Assume the role of an intrepid partygoer in a quest to get out of the given establishment because you've had a few too many drinks. Embark on various side quests and objectives to cement yourself as the life of the party scene, taking the city by storm as party sites fall one by one to your reign of intoxicated power.</p>

		<h2>A party started</h2>
		<p class="main">Work on this project started early last year, mostly as a joke. I had made a game a long, long time ago that focused around one very particular gimmick. The screen would consistently rotate in a circle, and the player object would diligently follow the cursor. As the cursor did not rotate with the screen, the player would never be capable of walking in a straight line without tremendous effort.<br /><br />And thus, <i>The Club Can't Even Handle Me Right Now</i> was born after revisiting the concept.</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Putting on beer goggles</h2>
		<p class="main">With the primary mechanic being the screen rotation, this game was originally set out to be based around other visual limitations and thematic obstacles, all to convey a sense of drunkenness. Visual limitations can be fun and well-incorporated (like a game where you need a torch to see in the darkness), but the original design of this game was exactly the opposite of that.<br /><br />In fact, the game's challenge derived purely from visual limiters. The screen rotation was constant and exceptionally irritating, the lighting system was too dark or too bright in places with no in between, and level design was focused around ambiguity and non-linearity. This all contributed to an absolutely awful (albeit <i>hilarious</i>) game. It received a lot of positive recognition amongst peers, but I always felt it was inferior.</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Redefining the party</h2>
		<p class="main">Having stepped away from the game and now returned to it once more, I've changed my focus for design. While it will retain a lot of the visual elements of the original game, the new version will tone down the intensity and add more clarifying factors, creating a much more cohesive and fun game. Players familiar with my old work will still get to enjoy smashing bottles, knocking over tables, and stumbling around drunk out of their minds with no clue where to go or what to do.</p>
