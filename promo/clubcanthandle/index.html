		<h1>Turn down for what?</h1>
		<p class="main"><i>The Club Can't Even Handle Me Right Now</i> is a freeware game currently being developed for the Windows (and hopefully soon Mac) platforms. Assume the role of an intrepid partygoer in a quest to get out of the given establishment because you've had a few too many drinks. Embark on various side quests and objectives to cement yourself as the life of the party scene, taking the city by storm as party sites fall one by one to your reign of intoxicated power.</p>

		<p class="main">Work on this project started early last year, mostly as a joke. I had made a game a long, long time ago that focused around one very particular gimmick. The screen would consistently rotate in a circle, and the player object would diligently follow the cursor. As the cursor did not rotate with the screen, the player would never be capable of walking in a straight line without tremendous effort.<br /><br />And thus, <i>The Club Can't Even Handle Me Right Now</i> was born after revisiting the concept. Needless to say, the original mechanics have since been refined and made much more fun to work with than the above description.</p>

		<h2>Redefining the party</h2>
		<p class="main">Want to enjoy smashing bottles, knocking over tables, and stumbling around drunk out of your mind with no clue where to go or what to do? The most authentic drunkenness simulator game is approaching a closed beta state that you too can participate in!<br /><br />Although the final product is far from ready, beta testers can play the game sooner and help shape the game by offering feedback. Additionally, contributions for assets are more than welcome. If you are an interested Windows user, a Mac user interested in the game and/or port stability tests, or someone looking to contribute resources to the project, simply seek my attention via skype (username: tehpilot).<br /><br /><em>Beta tester space <b>is limited!</b></em></p>
