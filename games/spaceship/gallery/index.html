			<p><em>spaceship game</em> is a 2 to 4 player arena fighting game.</p>

			<img src="../images/screenshot1.png" />

			<p style="text-align: left;">Every projectile and attack that connects with your opponent increases their knockback value. Being hit launches the player away. Hitting the barrier does direct health damage, scaling with how fast the ship is moving at the moment of contact. Knock your opponents hard enough against the barrier to make them explode. The last intrepid space pilot standing wins the game.</p>
