			<p><em>spaceship game</em> is a 2 to 4 player arena fighting game.</p>

			<p style="text-align: left;">Every projectile and attack that connects with your opponent increases their knockback value. Being hit launches the player away. Hitting the barrier does direct health damage, scaling with how fast the ship is moving at the moment of contact. Knock your opponents hard enough against the barrier to make them explode. The last intrepid space pilot standing wins the game.</p>

			<p style="text-align: left;">Initially created as an entry to a game jam, <em>spaceship game</em> sees continued development and playtesting a year and a half after its inception. The game is hosted at <a href="https://www.castlepointanime.com/">Castle Point Anime Convention</a> and on select evenings in conjunction with members from the <a href="http://sgdc.ml/">Stevens Game Development Club</a> (SGDC).</p>
