			<p style="text-align: left;">The <em>Collector</em> is a sturdy, medium-weight spaceship that fights enemies with summoned space debris. Hitting your opponent consistently builds up energy, which releases a long bolt of energy that opens portals along the edge of the arena. Debris flies in from these openings, which can be picked up and re-launched as an offensive projectile.</p>

			<p style="text-align: left;">With good aim, good juggling -- and a little bit of awareness on what debris spawns -- a Collector's pilot can rack up damage quickly. Collectors that land many shots and stop to store their unused energy reduce the time between portal spawns. If left unchecked, a Collector becomes the conjurer of a deadly debris storm with the ability to open three portals at once.</p>

					<span class="ship-info-blue">Warp Drive / Junk Draw</span><br />
					<span class="ship-ability">Innate</span>
					<br />The Collector derives its power from an onboard warp drive. The drive begins the match unpowered, its required energy represented by <span class="val">5</span> rotating circles. Each bullet fired from the Collector that hits an enemy ship charges the drive.
					<br /><br />
					When the drive is filled, the Collector briefly charges before discharging a bolt of concentrated energy. The bolt travels instantenously to the edge of the playing field and opens a portal. <span class="val">1 to 3</span> exclamation points denote the rarity of the summon. After <span class="val">2</span> seconds, one or more pieces of <span class="prop">junk</span> will come out of the portal. If touched by the Collector, the junk is collected. <span class="val">1</span> piece at a time can be held in the Collector's inventory.
					<br /><br />
					When immobile, a piece of junk that remains on the playing field for <span class="val">1</span> second will despawn.
					<br /><br />
					<span class="ship-info-blue">Hold Fire</span><br />
					<span class="ship-ability">Movement Option</span>
					<br />While this button is held, the Collector will not deploy primary fire while aiming with the Right Stick.
					<br /><br />
					<span class="ship-info-blue">Gravity Discharge</span><br />
					<span class="ship-ability">Basic Ability: 25 Power (Single Cast)</span>
					<br />The Collector fires <span class="val">5</span> bullets in a <span class="val">15</span>-degree cone that deal <span class="val">4</span> damage each and inflict <span class="val">0.25</span> seconds of hitstun. The knockback applied by this spreadshot is always straight downwards.
					<br /><br />
					<span class="ship-info-blue">Junk Toss</span><br />
					<span class="ship-ability">Combat Option</span>
					<br />If the Collector is holding onto a piece of <span class="prop">junk</span>, it will be launched. Junk can be collected again after <span class="val">0.25</span> seconds of initial travel.
					<br /><br />
					<span class="ship-info-blue">Power Store / Junk Storm</span><br />
					<span class="ship-ability">Strong Ability: 75+ Power (Drain Cast), 75 Power (Single Cast)</span>
					<br />The Collector enters a low-energy state, losing the ability to shoot primary fire. During this time, the Collector moves all collected Power into its primary energy repository.
					<br /><br />
					The repository holds <span class="val">140 Energy</span>, and power is converted at the rate of <span class="val">21</span> Power to per second (0.35 Power/frame) to <span class="val">30 Energy</span> (0.50 Energy/frame). When the repository is maxed out, the number of primary fire rounds needed to trigger Junk Draw is reduced by <span class="val">1</span> (down to <span class="val">2</span>, from a starting amount of <span class="val">5</span>).
					<br /><br />
					After reaching a two-round charge for Junk Draw, Power Store is replaced by Junk Storm. Upon casting, the Collector fires <span class="val">3</span> bolts in a <span class="val">15</span>-degree cone, each of which creates a portal at the edge of the arena.

			Originally developed in conjunction with atmospheric scientists, the Autonomous Space Debris Tracker-100 was an entry series of unmanned, remotely-observed satellites used to map the locations of debris in low orbit around Earth. As the Deep Space Exploration Initiative took off, the ASDT-100 series was repurposed to map the stars. The cartographic data stored onboard became a target for enemy factions and alien lifeforms, and many early exploration units were captured and ultimately destroyed.
			<br /><br />In a bid to better protect the ASDT-100 model, scientists began incorporating acquired warp-drive technology as a means of offense - one that usually created more debris, but proved effective at keeping assailants at bay.</p>
