<p>While this two-week summer class will get you acquainted with the basics of the Unity 3D engine and some concepts, there's more that goes into game development and design than the programming front. The most commercially successful and acclaimed games are very well constructed and make specific decisions designed to enthral and entertain their players. While the lectures and regular classes will help you learn how to build a game, these articles here will help you take your projects to the next level.</p>
