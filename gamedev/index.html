<h2 class="centered">lessons in game design</h2>
<p>I'm very happy to be acquainted with all of you during this class. Throughout the next two weeks, Professor DiCola and I will guide you through Unity 3D, where you will learn the basics of programming a game. While the ability to write a working game engine is a useful skill, there is much more to game design than programming.</p>
<p>Below I've written some useful articles about game design. These step away from the technical focus of the class, putting a focus on what aspects of a game make it enjoyable for the player. While it is one thing to write a functional game, it takes knowledge of other principles and concepts to make an experience that's fair and worthwhile for the player. All of these texts are entirely optional, but reading them will help you learn and avoid many mistakes first-time developers make. While it's highly unreasonable for both me to go into extreme detail and for you to fully understand all of these concepts, my hope is the articles will inspire thought, creativity, and discussion. If you begin to look at your own creations and others with a more critical and informed eye, my work here is done.</p>
<p>If you want to discuss a subject or need assistance outside of class, you're more than welcome to contact me. I'm more than happy to go further on any of these topics, lend a hand with your programming questions, or take suggestions for additional articles. My email address is listed below; you're also more than welcome to talk to me during class downtime or during breaks.<br><br>
