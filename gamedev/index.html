<h2 class="centered">lessons in game design</h2>
<p>While this two-week summer class will get you acquainted with the basics of the Unity 3D engine and some concepts, there's more that goes into game development and design than the programming front. The most commercially successful and acclaimed games are very well constructed and make specific decisions designed to enthral and entertain their players. While the lectures and regular classes will help you learn how to build a game, these articles here will help you take your projects to the next level.</p>
<p>Just to recap: I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at <a href="http://www.stevens.edu/sit/">Stevens Institute of Technology</a>, and I have a penchant for game design and programming. I have scored very well in local and online game programming competitions, and I (obviously) enjoy playing video games. Although I am still learning (and always will be!), I offer my present expertise in design to you. If you'd like to take a look at my work yourself, simply navigate to <a href="http://tehpilot.github.io/">the website's root page</a> for a thorough listing.</p>
<p>You are, by no means, required to read any of the following articles. I do, however, <em>strongly recommend</em> it. Two weeks is not enough time to discuss and analyze the subjects I will bring up, but my hope is you'll be able to leave the class with both mechanical knowledge and design knowledge in creating games. If you find yourself putting lots of effort and love into your project or thinking critically about the next video game you play, these articles (and by extension, me) will have done their job.</p>
<h2 class="centered">keeping in touch</h2>
<p>If you want to discuss a subject or need assistance outside of class, you're more than welcome to contact me. I'm more than happy to go further on any of these topics, lend a hand with your programming questions, or take suggestions for additional articles. My email address is listed below; you're also more than welcome to talk to me during class downtime or during breaks.<br><br>
